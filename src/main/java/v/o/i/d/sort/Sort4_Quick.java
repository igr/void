/**
 * Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer method for sorting. It works by partitioning an array into two parts,
 * then sorting the parts independently. As we shall see, the precise position of the partition depends on
 * the initial order of the elements in the input file. The crux of the method is the partitioning process,
 * which rearranges the array to make the following three conditions hold:
 * + The element a[i] is in its final place in the array for some i.
 * + None of the elements in a[l], ..., a[i-1] (on the left) is greater than a[i].
 * + None of the elements in a[i+1], ..., a[r] (on the right) is less than a[i].
 * <p/>
 * To partition an array, we choose an element, called a pivot, move all smaller elements before the pivot,
 * and move all greater elements after it.
 *
 * Average: O(n log(n))
 * Worst O(n^2)
 * Memory O(log(n))
 * Stable No

	/**
	 * We use the following general strategy to implement partitioning. First, we arbitrarily choose a[r] to be the
	 * partitioning elementâ€”the one that will go into its final position. Next, we scan from the left end of the array
	 * until we find an element greater than the partitioning element, and we scan from the right end of the array until
	 * we find an element less than the partitioning element. The two elements that stopped the scans are obviously out of
	 * place in the final partitioned array, so we exchange them.
	 *
	 * Continuing in this way, we ensure that no array elements to the left of the left index are greater than
	 * the partitioning element, and no array elements to the right of the right index are less than
	 * the partitioning element. When the scan indices cross, all that we need to do to complete the
	 * partitioning process is to exchange a[r] with the leftmost element of the right subfile (the element pointed to by the left index).
	 *
	 * The partitioning process divides a file into two subfiles that can be sorted independently.
