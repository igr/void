/**
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly-sorted lists,
 * and often is used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list one by one
 * and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list. In arrays, the new list and the remaining
 * elements can share the array's space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements
 * over by one. The insertion sort works just like its name suggests - it inserts each item into its proper place
 * in the final list. To save memory, most implementations use an in-place sort that works by moving the current
 * item past the already sorted items and repeatedly swapping it with the preceding item until it is in place.
 * Shell sort is a variant of insertion sort that is more efficient for larger lists.
 * This method is much more efficient than the bubble sort, though it has more constraints.
 *
 * Average: O(n + d), d is the number of inversions, which is O(nÂ²)
 * Worst: O(n^2)
 * Memory: O(1)
 * Stable: YES.
 *
 * Insertion sort uses about N^2/4 comparisons and N^2/4 half-exchanges (moves) on the average, and twice that many at worst.
